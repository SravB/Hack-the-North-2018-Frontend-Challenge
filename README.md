# Hack-the-North-2018-Frontend-Challenge

Hack the North 2018 Frontend Challenge made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript(jQuery).


## How To Use this WebApp

Simply clone the repo then open the HTML file with the browser of your choice. CLick on the buttons on the nav bar to jump to a certain section. In the schedule section, hover on an item to see it's description (if there's any given) and click on an item to add it to your personal schedule. In the personal schedule section, hover to check an item's description and click to delete an item from your personal schedule. 


## UX/UI Design

My goal for this web app was to create a simple yet aesthetic design which I aimed to achieve by utilizing the classic Hack the North colour scheme (white and blue shades) and various hover effects. I also colour coded each event by it's start time during the day. Events that are closer to midnight are dark blue and events that are closer to noon are a lighter shade of blue but their distinct shade is dependent on their distance from these two endpoints. This was accomplished by using a trig function to model the hex value of the colour for each event.


## Next Steps

Overall, I'm pleased with the progress I have made with this project in such a short amount of time. I completed this project in between studying for midterms and preparing for interviews so I definitely didn't have as much time as I would've liked to complete this project. On the other hand, completing this project amidst a ferocious sea of midterms and interviews push me to dissect problems and complete subgoals much more quickly and effectively.

Some next steps for this project include: 
* Converting the schedule from a list view into a table format with 3 columns (for times-similar to a classic online schedule, titles and locations) to further organize the information and improve readability. 
* Add icons for event tags (ie. food, logistics, etc.).
* Add more animations (interesting ones similar to the gears on the Hack the North 2017 website, and a circular progress bar for the countdown timer).
* Improve the background by using various Hack the North wallpapers that align with the colour scheme.
